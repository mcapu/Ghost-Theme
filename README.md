# Material theme for Ghost

This repository contains the source files required to create the final theme.
You can either compile the theme on your own or use https://github.com/mcapu/Ghost-Theme-Environment for a quick installation of a developer enviroment.

The theme uses [materialize](http://materializecss.com/) as its CSS framework.

* Scss goes in `css/main.scss`. Anything else will not get compiled, so make sure to reference it in that file.
* Fonts go in `fonts`
* Templates for ghost go in `templates`
* All the other files (e.g. `package.json`) you want to include go in the root.
